    I thought you said on the deal pericles, everybody understood them, 
    but they not meant the most of them God. Hallelujah. 
    All right. No man understands how be it where in the spirit. 
    So tongues are spiritual communication in the spirit. 
    Now observe look at verse here the prophesies speaks unto who? Unto who? Tonges speaks to who? 
    Prophecy speaks to who? So what did those folks hear on the day of pericles? Thank you. What is prophecy? 
    When tongues are interpreted. Let me see how you are following me, right? Just few. If you are not following me, 
    that means you are not really a Bible. Let me see how you are following me. You should fall. 
    I'm sweating. How you should? Hey, I'm preaching good. I'm not preaching good. Amen. 
    He the prophesies speaks to men. So tongues does not go to men. 
    It's when they are interpreted and men understand. Look at verse four. He that speaks in tongues, edifies who? edifies who? 
    So it's at no point a medium of communication with men. He edifies himself. He that prophesies edifies the church. 
    Verse five. I will that you all spoke with tongues, but rather that you prophesied for greater easy than prophesied 
    and he that he does preaching tongues except what? That what? So that means tongues not interpretation is equals to what? 
    Is it equals to what? Excellent. So in Acts 196, go to Acts 196, all right? Acts 196, if you are there say, amen. 
    Oh, you are not there. Wait for you. Acts 196. Are you there? 
    So let's go. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So that means it spoke with tongues and did what? What is prophecy? Uh-huh. 
    That means it spoke in tongues and interpreted it. 
    Now, who now under their predicate somebody to know to explain what happened? Who was the person? Uh-huh. 
    Now, is it not better for us to hear from him what happened? Then for us to think that Peter at least is what happened. 
    You don't understand. And that's what we have hoped we'll try to do over the years. 
    We'll try to tell those who were there what happened on the re-opinions. Peter explained what happened. 
    Now, we all know again, let me say again, tongues is, and prophecy is what? Uh-huh. 
    So when I speak with tongues it goes to who? When I interpret it it goes to who? 
    When I speak with tongues it goes to who? When I interpret it goes to who? When I speak in tongues it goes to who?
    When I interpret it goes to who? Good. Now, look at Acts 2. Peter explained what happened. 
    Verse 14. But Peter's time up with 11 litre of his voice and said unto them, ye men of Judean, all that dwell in Jerusalem. 
    Be it is known unto you and act into my words, for these are not drunk and as you suppose, seen it is but the third hour of the day. 
    Ah, the third hour of the day. Verse 16. Let's take it together. Verse 16. 
    But this is that which was spoken verse 7, thing. It shall come to. So the way I hold on, hold on. 
    Peter is explaining what happened, right? Who agrees with me? So let us follow Peter's reasoning. 
    Let's go. It shall come to. Everybody in the last day say it, 
    God, I will pour out of my spirit up on all flesh and your sons and daughters shall speak in tongues. 
    So what? So what? Go on. Your daughter should prophesy and your young men shall see visions. Your old men. Verse 18. 
    They shall prophesy. Look at verse 33. 
    Therefore, talking about Jesus, being by the right hand of God exalted and I will see the promise of the Father. 
    Ah, the Holy Ghost. He has shed for this which you now would see and hear. So what were they hearing? Ah, let's hear it. Come and be good. What were they hearing? Did they speak in tongues? Did they speak in tongues of their belly? God. They spoke in tongues and and and and that equals what? How have you got that? Action. So the dear Pentecost was not just tongues. It was tongues plus interpretation of tongues. Thongs are not meant for men. Thongs are meant for God. That is the unique communication of the new creation in Christ. Hallelujah. Resilum. Are we together? Come on guys, I will together. So go back to course, Corinthians 14. He that speaks in tongues speaks to God. He speaks to God. So when Peter said the spoken tongues in accent and magnified God, what was Peter referring to? Thongs and what? Exactly. That was how Peter got to know the remarkifying God because he spoke in tongues and then he spoke in a language Peter will understand. Is that clear? Is that very clear? Excellent. So, tongues can only be understood when they are interpreted. They can only be understood when they are interpreted. Look at first Corinthians 14 again. Verse 14. Are you there? Are you there? For you to know again, the tongues are not human languages. Look at first Corinthians 14. So he that speaks in tongues speaks not to men but to God. For no man understands him. Now if tongues were sons language, you could have said no man understands him. For Corinthians 14, 14. Let's go. Are you there? Yeah, there's a man. Let's go for if I pray in tongues my my what? My what? My what? Now my spirit is a spirit of God, right? Right? So if I pray in tongues, who is praying? That's why verse 2 says Peter speaks in tongues speaks in the spirit. If I speak in tongues, my spirit prays finish it now but my understand that's my mind is unfruitful. It's unfruitful. Verse 15. What is it then? I will pray what with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit. I will sing with the understanding. So Paul says we can pray in tongues. Now when I'm praying in tongues, let me give you this one as a bonus. Let's just say to go home with. When I'm praying in tongues, who is listening to me? When I'm praying and understanding, who is listening to me? What? Who? Good. When I'm singing in tongues, who is listening to me? When I'm singing in understanding, who is listening to me? That's just where it's going with. So praying in tongues is praying in the spirit. Do you all agree? Do you all agree? Excellent. I have been of you who prepared to be praying in tongues often. Joseph, we speak in tongues, Satan is confused, deliverance is started. You know, we're confused a little bit. You'll find some folks like that. Maybe they say they see a demon. He doesn't understand what you're saying. I've all I can't can hold your neck. I don't get you. Hallelujah. Because tongues have to communicate to you in the place of prayer, they're in the place of worship. Because he says in verse 16, he says, hell's went out blessed with the spirit. How shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say amen at the giving of what? Sing that he understands not what you say. Verse 17, let's go together for thou? That means when I sing in tongues and giving things well to God. But the other person who is that other person, the unlearned person, why is he unlearned? I don't know. Two ways, number one, because tongues are not for him anyway. Or secondly, maybe some folks that are really unlearned the things of God. They are very unlearned. So they're, what's your gift? I remember I was in one company thing, I was like, what's the gift? I was like, I can't say my gift is speaking in tongues. I said, my gift is drama. I'm not awful to the end. Is tongues for everybody? No. The questions should be, is everybody for tongues? Some are against it. They're pretty against it. The tongues, the Jesus give, speaking in tongues for everyone. He that believes this science shall follow. Amen. Amen. Do you believe that? So if you don't speak in tongues, why? And some people say, the speaking tongues only when something moves them. Maybe when they are, maybe when they want to cry out, they just are so much. All the rubles will get bullied. So once in a while like that, this speaking tongues. But the bad thing is you can pray in tongues and you can wash your God in tongues. Oh, they're well. It's not for everybody. So I do say so. I'll get to that next week. It's not for everybody. If you observe everywhere, people's spoken tongues, whether in Acts 2 or Acts 10 or Acts 19, have you observed that nobody was left out? So that means if they're not speaking in tongues, probably in the wrong church, the wrong place, everywhere, people's spoken tongues, the wrong popus eye, the wrong spoken. I'll part my spit upon some flesh, most flesh. What is it? Old flesh. The songs and daughters of the popus eye. Do you believe that? Do you believe that? To thank God for the gift of the Holy Ghost. So tongues are beyond the deopendicus. But they get rid of the book. Tongues are beyond the operas. Love it. Love the type of tongues are beyond the deopendicus. Tongues are for everyday living. How often do you pray? How often do you pray? Everyday? How often do you wash your God? So how often should you pray in tongues? How often should you sing in tongues? How do we do that this morning? It's after me. Let's go ahead. Let's just wash your God in tongues. You know, you won't bother about the person next to you. You know, because you're not talking to him. Amen. Amen. You know, you're not thinking about the person because you're not talking to him. You're talking to God. So let's go ahead and talk to God. Come on. Beyond the deopendicus.
